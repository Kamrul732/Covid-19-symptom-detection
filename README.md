Abstract: The covid-19 pandemic has created havoc around the world. Millions of people 
have been infected and millions are at risk. It is very tough for health organization and government to test each and every citizen for covid test. However, there are many symptoms of this virus. We can use machine learning to detect covid-19 virus. In this paper, we have implemented four different machine learning algorithms to detect covid-19 accurately. We have chosen the best algorithm, based on the accuracy.
First, we have collected a dataset of the symptoms of covid-19. Then we have processed the data and implemented the algorithms. We have implemented   Decision tree, Na√Øve Bayes, Neural network and Random forest. By performing these machine learning algorithms in our dataset, we have seen the accuracy of neural network is the highest with 98% accuracy. However, there are many aspects considered.
